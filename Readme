Pipelined brainfuck microprocessor

To program:

Use "bftomif.py" python program to turn your brainfuck program to mif memory file,
pad with zeroes if necessary to fill the memory.

Quick overview:

cache.vhd : 2-way associative cache that can be configured with generics. Used for forward jumps.
config.vhd : CPU configuration.
control.vhd : Program flow control, decides the next instruction and skips the next instruction if needed.
cpu.vhd : Top-level file that connects the other blocks.
datapath.vhd : Datapath, registers, adder and multiplexers. Executes the instruction.
decoder.vhd : Instruction decoder. Outputs signals that control the datapath.
memory.vhd : Instruction RAM, synchronous read and write.
reg_file.vhd : Registers, like instruction RAM but with asynchronous read.
stack.vhd : Stack, used to store backwards jump destinations.
uart.vhd : UART for communication with outside world.
